# vue-calculator

Vue 3 (with Vite) is not compatible because i'm using my old macbook (with old OS) :D.
So the only option for me is using Vue 2 to develop this project

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run serve
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
